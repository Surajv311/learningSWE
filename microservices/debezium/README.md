### Debezium/CDC Questions

1. What is Change Data Capture (CDC)?

   Change Data Capture (CDC) is a technique used to identify and capture changes made to data in a database.
   - It allows for tracking of changes such as inserts, updates, and deletes.
   - CDC can be used for data replication, synchronization, and analytics.
   - It enables real-time data integration between different systems.
   - CDC can help reduce the load on databases by minimizing the need for full data scans.

2. Why is CDC important in modern data architectures?

   CDC is important for several reasons:
   - It supports real-time data processing and analytics.
   - Reduces the need for batch processing, improving data freshness.
   - Facilitates data synchronization between multiple databases and services.
   - Helps maintain data integrity and consistency across systems.
   - Enables event-driven architectures by providing timely updates.

3. What is Debezium, and how does it relate to CDC?

   Debezium is an open-source distributed platform for CDC.
   - It captures changes from various database systems and streams them to Kafka.
   - Debezium provides connectors for multiple databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQL Server.
   - It ensures that data changes are captured in real-time, allowing downstream systems to react to those changes.
   - Debezium leverages existing database logs to track changes without impacting performance.

4. How does Debezium capture changes from a database?

   Debezium captures changes using the following process:
   - It connects to the database and reads the transaction logs (e.g., binary logs in MySQL).
   - It identifies changes (inserts, updates, deletes) made to the database tables.
   - It transforms the changes into a standard format (JSON) and publishes them to a Kafka topic.
   - Debezium can also handle different isolation levels to ensure accurate change capture.

5. What are the main components of a Debezium setup?

   The main components of a Debezium setup include:
   - **Debezium Connectors**: Capture changes from specific databases.
   - **Kafka**: Acts as a message broker to stream the change events.
   - **Kafka Connect**: Integrates Debezium with Kafka, allowing connectors to read and write data.
   - **Kafka Consumers**: Applications that process the change events from Kafka topics.
   - **Schema Registry**: Optional component that manages schemas for messages in Kafka.

6. What are the benefits of using Debezium for CDC?

   Using Debezium for CDC offers several benefits:
   - Real-time data streaming and low latency for data updates.
   - Support for multiple database systems with a unified approach.
   - Schema evolution handling, allowing changes to the database schema to be captured and reflected in the stream.
   - Easy integration with other systems and services via Kafka.
   - Minimal impact on source databases since it reads from transaction logs.

7. How does Debezium handle schema changes?

   Debezium handles schema changes through:
   - Automatic detection of changes in the database schema using snapshots or log reading.
   - Publishing schema changes as events in the Kafka topics alongside data changes.
   - Providing a schema registry integration to maintain schema versions and compatibility.

8. What are some common use cases for Debezium?

   Common use cases for Debezium include:
   - Real-time data replication between databases (e.g., MySQL to PostgreSQL).
   - Event-driven architectures that react to data changes (e.g., triggering workflows).
   - Data synchronization for microservices that need up-to-date information.
   - Capturing audit trails for regulatory compliance by tracking all changes made to critical data.

9. What challenges can arise when using CDC with Debezium?

   Challenges when using CDC with Debezium may include:
   - Managing data consistency during change capture, especially during high-volume operations.
   - Handling large volumes of change events efficiently without overwhelming downstream systems.
   - Ensuring compatibility with various database systems and versions due to differences in log formats.
   - Monitoring and managing the performance of the Kafka cluster to prevent bottlenecks.

10. How do you monitor the health of a Debezium connector?

    You can monitor the health of a Debezium connector by:
    - Using the Kafka Connect REST API to check the status of connectors and tasks.
    - Reviewing the logs of the Debezium connector for any error messages or warnings.
    - Implementing metrics and monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to visualize connector performance and health.
    - Setting up alerts based on specific thresholds or error rates to proactively address issues.

11. How does Debezium ensure exactly-once delivery semantics?

    Debezium ensures exactly-once delivery semantics through:
    - Integration with Kafkaâ€™s transactional capabilities, allowing it to publish messages atomically.
    - Using offsets stored in Kafka topics to track processed records accurately.

12. Can you explain how snapshotting works in Debezium?

    Snapshotting in Debezium involves:
    - Taking an initial snapshot of the database at a specific point in time before capturing ongoing changes from transaction logs.
    - This ensures that all existing records are captured before real-time change streaming begins.

Others:

- Setup working condition: Working. 
- The way debezium container is configured in docker compose file, we use `entrypoint` instead of `command` to run the sh script, in order to override and fix up cURL command issues we were facing to register to Kafka connect automatically, than manual intervention.
- We could hit the cURL command written in bash file manually by entering the debezium container and hitting it, but rather we automated this process so that when container is up via compose, it is hit automatically.
- Also, the sh script may not be executable directly in beginning so ensure you run `chmod +x <name>` command on it. 
- Debezium requires changing wal_level='logical' in postgres. It has not been an easy direct way. 
  - To view wal level in your postgres:
  ```
  psql -U postgres_user_suraj -d weatherdb
  SHOW wal_level; (definitely put semi colon)
  ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level=logical; (To alter wal_level) 
  ```
  - Also, for ref: 
  ```
  weatherdb=# SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;
  pid | usesysid |       usename       |  application_name  | client_addr | client_hostname | client_port |         backend_start         | backend_xmin |   state   | sent_lsn  | write_lsn | flush_lsn | replay_lsn | write_lag | flush_lag | replay_lag | sync_priority | sync_state |          reply_time

- Also debezium moved its images from dockerhub to quay which I used: https://debezium.io/blog/2023/04/25/container-images-quayio/. Using dockerhub debezium images were also giving me platform issues, so quay was better and updated.
